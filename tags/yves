        "value": "Before joining BlockBerryCreative, Yves was a part of a dance group at D-Pop Studio (by Dream Vocal & Dance Academy). Yves said she joined the group secretly because her mother was against it. She studied really hard and ranked #11 in her studies at school, but in Grade 11 revealed her secret to her mother because she really wanted to become a singer.[citation needed] Yves was last seen with the dance group, a month before her reveal, when they released a dance cover. At some point in the latter half of 2017 after September, Yves was accepted as a trainee at Polaris Entertainment. Despite her audition not being ideal, as she was only notified the night before, she was accepted the next day after performing a song and original choreography. Similar to other members, she was transferred to BlockBerryCreative at some point in order to become a member."
