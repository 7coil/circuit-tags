What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I finished a project, and I've been involved in numerous secret projects in Discord, and I have over 300 confirmed projects on github. I am trained in memeing and I'm the top cunt in the >terminal_ discord server. You are nothing to me but just another joke. I will meme you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before in Circuit and Friends, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of Veld alts across the world. Your IP is being traced so you better prepare, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your egirl. You're dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can meme in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare head. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Discord T&S and I will use it to wipe your miserable ass off the face of Discord, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit dank memes all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
